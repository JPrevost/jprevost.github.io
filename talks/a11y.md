  ## What is web accessibility?
  - The site is usable by everyone.
  - Intentional access restrictions like MIT only are okay.
  - Anyone that is authorized to use a site can actually use it.

## Why do we care?
One example of one type of disability / impairment.

#### Vision Impairment and Blindness
- [36 million legally blind globally](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/)
- 217 million (not including blind) visually impaired

#### Perspective
- ~325 million people live in the US

## Is it hard to be compliant?
- Usually not.
- It's definitely much easier if you address a11y from the start.
- If you do, it's not hard to achieve usable websites.

## Beyond Automated Tooling
- Passing automated tests is not enough to catch all serious concerns (even if it's a great start).
- Local coding projects should schedule an accessibility plan review with UX (Frances) early in the project.
- Most projects should, coordinated through UX, schedule a formal review by MIT ATIC towards the end of the project. The process for this can be discussed during the previously mentioned early internal review.
